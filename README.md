# Moving Out, the App.
---

# Overview:

The Moving Out app is a new way to interact and find used furniture in your area.

We all use Facebook to connect with people and look at user post and activity.
We also all, well most, use craigslist when we are looking or trying to sell
items, specifically furniture. use  Thousands of people are moving in and out of apartments on a daily basis! Why  Taking turns, two players attempt to match all pairs of cards shown in the
least amount of time. After each player has completed their round, the winner of the game is announced!

Each player will be randomly shown 16 cards with their faces down.
Select two of the cards by clicking on each with your mouse.
The cards will face up. If both cards are the same, (i.e you got a match) the cards will keep facing up.
Otherwise (i.e No match!), the cards will face back down after one second.
If the cards are different, the player must remember what is on the card so they can try
again and get all matches in the least amount of time.
The game is over when you have matched all of the pairs, and all the cards are faced upwards.
